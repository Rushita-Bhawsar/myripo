          <p class="mb-4">Acupressure is an ancient healing practice rooted in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). It involves applying pressure to specific points on the body to promote healing and wellness. Here's an overview of how acupressure treatment works:</p>
          <div class="des">
            <ul>
              <li class="list-item">
                <p class="roboto-bold">Understanding Pressure Points</p>
                <p class="roboto-regular"><span class="roboto-medium">Meridian System</span> :- According to TCM, the body has a network of energy channels called meridians. These meridians are believed to carry vital energy, or "qi" (pronounced "chee"), throughout the body.</p>
                <p class="roboto-regular"><span class="roboto-medium">Acupressure Points</span> :- Along these meridians are specific points, known as acupressure points or acupoints. These points are thought to be connected to different organs and systems in the body.</p>
              </li>
              <li class="list-item">
                <p class="roboto-bold">Applying Pressure</p>
                <p class="roboto-regular"><span class="roboto-medium">Technique</span> :- Practitioners use their fingers, palms, elbows, or special tools to apply pressure to acupoints. The pressure can be applied in a circular motion or held steadily for a certain period.</p>
                <p class="roboto-regular"><span class="roboto-medium">Intensity</span> :- The intensity of the pressure varies depending on the treatment goal and the patient's sensitivity. It can range from gentle touch to firm pressure.</p>
              </li>
              <li class="list-item">
                <p class="roboto-bold">Mechanisms of Action</p>
                <p class="roboto-regular"><span class="roboto-medium">Stimulating Qi Flow</span> :- By applying pressure to acupoints, acupressure aims to unblock and stimulate the flow of qi, restoring balance and harmony within the body.</p>
                <p class="roboto-regular"><span class="roboto-medium">Releasing Endorphins</span> :- Acupressure can trigger the release of endorphins, the body's natural painkillers, which help reduce pain and induce a sense of well-being.</p>
                <p class="roboto-regular"><span class="roboto-medium">Improving Circulation</span> :- The pressure applied can enhance blood circulation, promoting the delivery of oxygen and nutrients to tissues and aiding in the removal of metabolic waste products.</p>
              </li>
              <li class="list-item">
                <p class="roboto-bold">Therapeutic Effects</p>
                <p class="roboto-regular"><span class="roboto-medium">Pain Relief</span> :- Acupressure can help alleviate various types of pain, including headaches, muscle tension, and chronic pain conditions.</p>
                <p class="roboto-regular"><span class="roboto-medium">Stress Reduction</span> :- It promotes relaxation and reduces stress by activating the parasympathetic nervous system, which counteracts the stress response.</p>
                <p class="roboto-regular"><span class="roboto-medium">Boosting Immune Function</span> :- By improving the flow of qi and blood, acupressure can enhance the body's natural defenses against illness.</p>
                <p class="roboto-regular"><span class="roboto-medium">Enhancing Digestion</span> :- Specific acupoints can be targeted to improve digestive functions and alleviate gastrointestinal issues.</p>
                <p class="roboto-regular"><span class="roboto-medium">Balancing Emotions</span> :- Acupressure can help regulate emotions and improve mental clarity by harmonizing the body's energy flow.</p>
              </li>
              <li class="list-item">
                <p class="roboto-bold">Treatment Process</p>
                <p class="roboto-regular"><span class="roboto-medium">Initial Assessment</span> :- The practitioner begins with an assessment of the patient's health condition, including their medical history, symptoms, and overall well-being.</p>
                <p class="roboto-regular"><span class="roboto-medium">Identification of Acupoints</span> :- Based on the assessment, the practitioner identifies the appropriate acupoints to target during the session.</p>
                <p class="roboto-regular"><span class="roboto-medium">Application of Pressure</span> :- The practitioner applies pressure to the identified acupoints using specific techniques tailored to the patient's needs.</p>
                <p class="roboto-regular"><span class="roboto-medium">Session Duration</span> :- A typical acupressure session lasts between 30 to 60 minutes. The number of sessions required depends on the individual's condition and response to treatment.</p>
              </li>
              <li class="list-item">
                <p class="roboto-bold">Aftercare and Self-Care</p>
                <p class="roboto-regular"><span class="roboto-medium">Post-Session</span> :- After a session, patients may feel relaxed, energized, or experience temporary soreness at the acupoints.</p>
                <p class="roboto-regular"><span class="roboto-medium">Self-Acupressure</span> :- Practitioners may teach patients self-acupressure techniques to use between sessions for continued relief and maintenance of benefits.</p>
